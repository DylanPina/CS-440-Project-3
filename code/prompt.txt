The Data Set
Each diagram is a 20x20 pixel image, that has been generated in the following way:
  Starting with rows, pick a random number from 1 to 20 and a random color from fRed, Blue, Yellow, Greeng,
and color that row that color.
  Switching to columns, pick a random number from 1 to 20 and a random color (di erent from the  rst), and
color that column that color, coloring over the previously colored row at the point of intersection.
  Switching back to rows, pick a random number from 1 to 20 (di erent from the  rst randomly selected row),
and a random color (di erent from the  rst two), and color that row that color, coloring over the previously
colored column at the point of intersection.
  Switching back to columns, pick a random number from 1 to 20 (di erent from the  rst randomly selected
column), and take the remaining unselected color, and color that column that color, coloring over the previously
colored columns at the points of intersection.
  Note: The same instructions should be applied starting with columns instead of rows, with 50% chance.

If the Red wire is laid before a Yellow wire, this image is marked as `Dangerous' (1), otherwise it is marked as `safe` (0).
Among the images marked `Dangerous', the wire color to cut is always the 3rd wire laid down.

One-hot encoding for the colors of the wires are as follows:
    NO_WIRE = [0, 0, 0, 0]
    RED = [0, 0, 0, 1]
    BLUE = [0, 0, 1, 0]
    YELLOW = [0, 1, 0, 0]
    GREEN = [1, 0, 0, 0]

We represent the 20 x 20 wire diagram as a flattened 1600 one-hot encoded vector.

We want to have model on the data set to take as input a wiring diagram and give as output whether or not it is dangerous

I want you to generate some non-linear features for this model, determined in a non-ad hoc way. Draw inspiration from convolutional nueral network by generating features based on locality in a given square of local pixels.
